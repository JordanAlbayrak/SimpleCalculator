On change #4 :
I added a exponant method which raises the first number by the second number. In order to make this method possible I used Math.Pow which made things really easy, all I had to do was add this into my CalculatorEngine library.

On change #5 : 
I removed a redundent if statement and used a switch case instead for a cleaner look. I added a couple titles with some dash marks to add clarity.
